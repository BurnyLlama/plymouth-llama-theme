# plymouth-llama-theme
It's called "llama theme" but there's no llamas... Sounds like false advertising....

# Installation:
As of now I have no install-script, allthough that is to be fixed in a later addition.

## Basic Guide:
```
$ |  sudo su
# |  cp -r /path/to/source/* /path/to/plymouth/theme/folder
# |  plymouth-set-default-theme llama -R
# |  reboot
```
## Customization
Inside the "llama.script" you can find some variables at the top that are toggable (true/false), you can change those to your liking.
